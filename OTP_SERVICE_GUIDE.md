# OTP Service Guide

## Overview
The OTP (One-Time Password) service is now working properly with the following improvements:

1. **Database Storage**: OTPs are now stored in MongoDB instead of in-memory
2. **SMS Service**: Integrated SMS service with console logging for development
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam OTP requests
4. **Attempt Tracking**: Limits failed verification attempts
5. **Auto-cleanup**: Expired OTPs are automatically removed

## How It Works

### 1. OTP Generation
- User requests OTP by providing phone number
- System generates a 4-digit OTP
- OTP is stored in database with 5-minute expiration
- SMS is sent (console log in development mode)
- Rate limiting prevents multiple requests within 5 minutes

### 2. OTP Verification
- User enters the 4-digit OTP
- System validates against stored OTP
- Tracks failed attempts (max 5 attempts)
- Marks OTP as verified on success
- Auto-deletes expired OTPs

## Current Status: âœ… WORKING

The OTP service is now fully functional. Here's what was fixed:

### Issues Resolved:
1. **Missing Environment Files**: Created `.env` files for both frontend and backend
2. **In-Memory Storage**: Replaced with MongoDB storage
3. **No SMS Service**: Added SMS service with console logging
4. **No Rate Limiting**: Added rate limiting to prevent spam
5. **No Attempt Tracking**: Added attempt tracking for security

### Testing Results:
```
âœ… MongoDB connected
âœ… OTP created: 3812
âœ… SMS sent: true
âœ… OTP verified successfully
ðŸŽ‰ All tests completed successfully!
```

## How to Use

### For Development:
1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Request OTP** from the frontend checkout page

3. **Check server console** for the OTP:
   ```
   ==================================================
   ðŸ“± SMS SENT (Development Mode)
   ==================================================
   ðŸ“ž To: +91-9876543210
   ðŸ”¢ OTP: 3812
   ðŸ’¬ Message: Your Cafe Tamarind verification code is: 3812. Valid for 5 minutes.
   ==================================================
   ```

4. **Enter the OTP** in the frontend verification form

### For Production:
1. **Set up SMS provider** (Twilio, AWS SNS, etc.)
2. **Configure environment variables**:
   ```env
   SMS_PROVIDER=twilio
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_number
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"OTP not found"**
   - OTP may have expired (5-minute limit)
   - Request a new OTP

2. **"Too many failed attempts"**
   - Wait 5 minutes or request a new OTP
   - Maximum 5 failed attempts allowed

3. **"Please wait X minutes"**
   - Rate limiting prevents spam
   - Wait for the specified time before requesting new OTP

4. **"Failed to send OTP"**
   - Check server logs for errors
   - Verify MongoDB connection
   - Check SMS service configuration

### Debug Steps:

1. **Check server logs** for OTP generation
2. **Verify MongoDB connection** in backend
3. **Test OTP service** using the test script:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node test-otp.js
   ```

## API Endpoints

}
```

## Security Features

1. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents OTP spam
2. **Attempt Tracking**: Limits failed verifications
3. **Auto-expiration**: OTPs expire after 5 minutes
